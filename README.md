# RNN-TV-Script-Generator

In this project, we'll generate your own Simpsons TV scripts using RNNs. We'll be using part of the Simpsons dataset of scripts from 27 seasons. The Neural Network we'll build will generate a new TV script for a scene at Moe's Tavern.

### Get the Data:

The data is in the repository. We'll be using a subset of the original dataset. It consists of only the scenes in Moe's Tavern. This doesn't include other versions of the tavern, like "Moe's Cavern", "Flaming Moe's", "Uncle Moe's Family Feed-Bag", etc.
